# Product Trace

**ProductTrace** is a decentralized application for registering, authenticating, and tracking ownership of luxury designer products—starting with handbags—using a blockchain-backed ledger.

This project demonstrates how peer-to-peer communication, hashing, and blockchain validation can be applied to combat counterfeiting and ensure transparent ownership history.
